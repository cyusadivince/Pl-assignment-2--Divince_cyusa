This directory, as shown in the screenshot, contains screenshots of what I have done. It holds images that are used for creating PDBs (Pluggable Databases) like plsql_class2025db and di_plsqlauca_27516
as well as the deletion of the pdb(di_plsqlauca_27516) Moreover, this directory also features resources related to the OEM (Oracle Enterprise Manager) dashboard, which is used for managing and monitoring
the Oracle databases and systems.
